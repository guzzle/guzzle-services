Provides an implementation of the Guzzle Command library that uses Guzzle service descriptions to describe web services, serialize requests, and parse responses into easy to use model structures.

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Command\Guzzle\GuzzleClient;
use GuzzleHttp\Command\Guzzle\Description;

$client = new Client();
$description = new Description([
	'baseUrl' => 'http://httpbin.org/',
	'operations' => [
		'testing' => [
			'httpMethod' => 'GET',
			'uri' => '/get{?foo}',
			'responseModel' => 'getResponse',
			'parameters' => [
				'foo' => [
					'type' => 'string',
					'location' => 'uri'
				],
				'bar' => [
					'type' => 'string',
					'location' => 'query'
				]
			]
		]
	],
	'models' => [
		'getResponse' => [
			'type' => 'object',
			'additionalProperties' => [
				'location' => 'json'
			]
		]
	]
]);

$guzzleClient = new GuzzleClient($client, $description);

$result = $guzzleClient->testing(['foo' => 'bar']);
echo $result['args']['foo'];
// bar
```

## Installing

This project can be installed using Composer:

``composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle-services``

For **Guzzle 5**, use ``composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle-services:0.6``.

**Note:** If Composer is not installed [globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally) then you may need to run the preceding Composer commands using ``php composer.phar`` (where ``composer.phar`` is the path to your copy of Composer), instead of just ``composer``.

## Plugins

* Load Service description from file [https://github.com/gimler/guzzle-description-loader]

## Transition guide from Guzzle 5.0 to 6.0
 
### Change regarding PostField and PostFile

The request locations `postField` and `postFile` were removed in favor of `formParam` and `multipart`. If your description looks like
 
```php
[
    'baseUri' => 'http://httpbin.org/',
    'operations' => [
        'testing' => [
            'httpMethod' => 'GET',
            'uri' => '/get{?foo}',
            'responseModel' => 'getResponse',
            'parameters' => [
                'foo' => [
                    'type' => 'string',
                    'location' => 'postField'
                ],
                'bar' => [
                    'type' => 'string',
                    'location' => 'postFile'
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ],
]
```

you need to change `postField` to `formParam` and `postFile` to `multipart`. 

More documentation coming soon.
